# Food Delivery Tycoon

This game was made over the course of three days for a JET hackathon. It was hosted at https://fooddeliverytycoon.com, although I've revoked the Mapbox token for now until I integrate it into the deploy pipeline, as its currently hardcoded.

To run, clone the repo and run `quasar dev`. You'll need your own Mapbox token which goes [here](https://github.com/gkinsman/FoodDeliveryTycoon/blob/master/src/Features/data/mapbox.ts#L12).

Enjoy!
